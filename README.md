# Stock manager

This was my project for the internal assessment of the subject "Computer Science" in the International Baccalaureate diploma. 
The application is a stock management software for a dental clinic. It was my very first application software, so any suggestions or improvements would be appreciated :)

The project is divided into the following parts:
- `app.py`: main file. 
- `sqlite.py`: handles db interaction with SQLite module.
- `frame_base.py`: basic functionalities of each frame.
- `frame_stock.py`: shows available products.
- `frame_historial.py`: historical data of purchases and related functions.
- `graficos.py`: creates the graphics for the historical data using Matplotlib
